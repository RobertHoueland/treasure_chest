# Treasure Chest Assignment
This simple file lets the user work with a treasure chest of waterbottles.

The user can control and change the chest, including adding a bottle, removing a bottle, viewing a bottle, or moving bottles.

The waterbottle struct contains a string color, a size float, a string brand, and a value float.

These are all stored as an array, and have helper functions for the user to use.
